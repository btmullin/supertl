# Project supertl

supertl is short for Super Training Log.

I was a long time user of SportTracks 3.0.  This was an incredibly powerful and extensible workout traininglog that was amazing.  Sadly the developer went the web based SAS route and the desktop application was suset into oblivion.  The .mobi version just didn't have the same power and flexibility that the desktop version did.

This project is my hobby non-training time, "keep me out of the bars", pet project to create a ghost of the tool that ST 3.0 used to be.
